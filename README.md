Personal Website – Manmeet Sagri

This is my assignment website. It’s a simple personal homepage where I show who I am, what I study, my projects, and some fun interactive visualizations. The goal was to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to make a website that feels like a mix between a resume and a small portfolio. There isn’t much complexity yet since I’m still practicing my skills.

Purpose

Practice making a website with HTML.

Style it with CSS to make it look clean.

Add small JavaScript interactions so it feels less static.

Try out SVG drawings and visualizations made with JS.

Files in my project

index.html
Main homepage. Has about me, education, skills, projects, and contact info. Navigation menu at the top.

style.css
Handles the design. Fonts, sticky header, flexbox layout for my photo and project sections, spacing, colors, etc.

main.js
Adds interactivity. Includes a back-to-top button, image hover zoom effect, and typewriter animation for my name.

visualizations.html
A second page for SVG visualizations. Has my weekly schedule bar chart and a cat face that blinks and changes nose color.

vis.js
JavaScript code that creates the SVGs. Uses loops and helper functions to draw the bar chart and cat face. Includes hover and click interactions.


How to view

Open index.html in a browser to see the homepage.

Use the menu at the top to move around sections.

Click “Visualizations” in the menu to see my chart and cat face.

Try scrolling to see the back-to-top button, hover on images to zoom, and watch the typewriter effect on my name.

On the visualizations page, hover on the cat to make it blink and click the nose to change color.
